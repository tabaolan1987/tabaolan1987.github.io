##Selenium Introduction

###About Selenium

Selenium is a software testing framework for the web that facilitates the automation of browsers. The Selenium project produces various tools for automation testing such as Selenium IDE, Selenium Remote Control (RC), Selenium Grid and Selenium 2.0 & WebDriver. Learning all the tools will give you many different options for approaching different automation problems. The entire suits of tools result in a rich set of testing functions specially geared to the needs of testing of web application of all types.

###Why Selenium

- Selenium is an open source tool with Corporate backing.
- The tests can then be run against most modern web browsers.
- Selenium deploys on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh platforms.
- It allows recording, editing, and debugging tests.
- Recorded tests can be exported in most language e.g. html, Java, .net, perl, ruby etc.
- Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser.

###Selenium WebDriver

The primary new feature in Selenium 2.0 is the integration of the WebDriver API. WebDriver is designed to provide a simpler, more concise programming interface in addition to addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API. It enables you to use a programming language to write test scripts in different programming languages like html, Java, .net , perl, ruby and which enables you to use conditional operations, looping and other programming concepts which makes you test script robust. Selenium-WebDriver was developed to better support dynamic web pages where elements of a page may change without the page itself being reloaded. WebDriverâ€™s goal is to supply a well-designed object-oriented API that provides improved support for modern advanced web-app testing problems.
